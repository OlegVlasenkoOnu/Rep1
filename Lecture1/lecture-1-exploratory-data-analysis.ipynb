    "The tasks that are assigned to analysts are quite diverse. However, it all starts with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will not touch on the business side of data analysis, but at the same time, we need to understand that data is not taken \"out of thin air\". As well as the tasks associated with it. In the book written by [Bill Franks](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/%D0%91_%D0%A4%D1%80%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%81_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B2_%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BA_%D0%B2_%D1%8D%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D1%83_Big_Dat?id=yPvkDQAAQBAJ) about operational analytics, the author focuses on the fact that ill-conceived investments in the collection and storage of data on the principle of \"what if they come in handy later\" often do not justify themselves. Only after a specific goal has been set the process of collecting (or possibly buying) and analyzing data can begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, in practice, raw data is usually unsuitable and/or unusable for analysis. The process of preparing and cleaning the data (data preparation, preprocessing, data cleaning) can be **very time-consuming** and take more time than actually building and validating models based on data. Let's highlight some of the components of this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- data specification and understanding\n",
    "- data editing, error correction\n",
    "- working with missing values\n",
    "- normalization (standartization)\n",
    "- feature extraction and selection\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we obtain data in a convenient format, usually in a tabular format. A table (or dataframe) has a \"objects-features\" structure: rows correspond to individual entities (objects, examples, instances), and columns correspond to attributes of these entities (features). We will see the example very soon."

    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level general purpose programming language. Today it is the most popular programming language in Data Science and Machine Learning. However, \"pure\" Python has a number of disadvantages, mainly related to code execution time. Traditional data structures like lists and tuples, as well as \"for-\" and \"while-\" loops, are \"slow\", and in the case of big data analysis this becomes a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the most clear explanation of \"slowness\" of standard data types and loops we can see in the book by Jake VanderPlas: [https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (chapter 2, the paragraph \"Understanding Data Types in Python\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library is designed to work with multidimensional arrays (ndarrays) in such a way that the execution time for large data operations is **significantly faster** (sometimes hundreds or even thousands of times) than using \"pure\" Python. The library contains a large number of fast and high-level operations with one-, two- and multidimensional arrays (tensors), as well as a number of vector and matrix algebra functions. All higher-level libraries in the Python ecosystem work on the basis of NumPy arrays (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow deep learning libraries, PyTorch and many others), which makes studying the ideology of NumPy arrays and the capabilities of this library a \"must-have\" skill for a data analyst."

    "## Pandas library\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library for loading, preprocessing, transforming and combining data as well as for exploratory data analysis. Exploratory analysis precedes directly the construction of predictive machine learning models and is designed to help the researcher better understand the features of the dataset, the relationship (correlation) between features, and also draw the first simple conclusions based on the data. However, \"simple\" does not mean \"bad\". These (at first glance) primitive conclusions provide baselines for subsequent more complex models, and it may turn out that it is the patterns found at the exploratory analysis stage that will help achieve the desired goal without diving into complex machine learning models."

    "\n",
    "An important component of exploratory data analysis is data visualization. High-quality graphs and charts help you see more than boring and monotonous tables. The Pandas library has built-in visualization tools based on Matplotlib graphics. The [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library itself provides many low-level graphical tools, so that the researcher can control literally everything --- from the color of points to fonts on the coordinate axes. The [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) library contains more high-level features and is intended to make life easier for Matplotlib users to some extent by automating many routine things. Typically, the built-in Pandas graphics, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used together, which we will demonstrate later."
